## Background ##
 
For this project we explored the dataset related to adoption of mobile phones across different countries between 1960 and 2019. We used Whimsical for sketching our project plan.
We have created a dashboard with 3 visualizations that include a heat map, line chart and bubble chart with an ability to change the charts based on the country selection and year. These visualisations show the number of mobile telephone subscriptions, measured as the number per 100 people versus gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.

## Development process and technologies ##

* We designed a web page using Python Flask-powered API, HTML, CSS and Javascript to show the dashboard.
* We have uploaded the technology adoption data to PostgreSQL database server using Flask API application
* GeoJON data for map is assessed by using d3 queries to link on GitHub
* We used multiple selection menu and slider as new features for user interaction. 
* All three visualizations are updated simultaneously when user submit their selection or select year from the slider 
* The [application](https://technologyadoption.herokuapp.com/) was successfully deployed online using Heroku.
